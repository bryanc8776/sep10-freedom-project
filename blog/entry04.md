# Entry 4: Choosing a LOYO Tool
##### 2/25/24

### Tool
The tool I chose to learn on my own is [**A-Frame**](https://aframe.io/). **A-Frame** is a web framework based on top of HTML that is mainly used to build virtual reality (VR) experiences and 3D scenes. I have tried to learn how to use **A-Frame** by watching videos like "[Aframe Webvr - VR Development Part 1 - Setting Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_FIByQUAI)" and tinkering with the starter example on Glitch. In the example, I added a new shape with the code `<a-cone position="0.5 1 -3" radius="3" color="black"></a-cone>`. I also changed some values of the other shapes already in the example like their position, color, and size. This is how the preview of the code looked after I changed it.

### Skills
A skill I improved on throughout this experience was **Debugging**. At first, I struggled to understand **A-Frame** and how to change the example. The code I added was not working, so I tried to look for more information on how **A-Frame** and the code works. After some research and more tinkering with the code, I was able to do something like shown in the image above.

Another skill was **Growth mindset**. I struggled a lot trying to tinker with **A-Frame** and felt like I wouldn't be able to learn how to make it work. Despite the struggle, I continued to try to create a new shape and finally I was able to create a cone.
