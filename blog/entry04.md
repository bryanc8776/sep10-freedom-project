# Entry 4: Choosing a LOYO Tool
##### 2/25/24

### Tool
The tool I chose to learn on my own is [**A-Frame**](https://aframe.io/). **A-Frame** is a web framework based on top of HTML that is mainly used to build virtual reality (VR) experiences and 3D scenes. I have tried to learn how to use **A-Frame** by watching videos like "[Aframe Webvr - VR Development Part 1 - Setting Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_FIByQUAI)" and tinkering with the starter example on Glitch. In the example, I added a new shape with the code `<a-cone position="0.5 1 -3" radius="3" color="black"></a-cone>`. I also changed some values of the other shapes already in the example like their position, color, and size.
