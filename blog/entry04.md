# Entry 4: Choosing a LOYO Tool
##### 2/25/24

### Tool
The tool I chose to learn on my own is [**A-Frame**](https://aframe.io/). **A-Frame** is a web framework based on top of HTML that is mainly used to build virtual reality (VR) experiences and 3D scenes. I have tried to learn how to use **A-Frame** by watching videos like "[Aframe Webvr - VR Development Part 1 - Setting Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_FIByQUAI)" and tinkering with the starter example on Glitch.
