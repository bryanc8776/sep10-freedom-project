# Entry 6: Building a MVP
##### 5/1/24

### MVP
To make a *Minimum Viable Product* website for **Accounting**, I had to choose a [bootstrap template](https://startbootstrap.com/?showAngular=false&showVue=false&showPro=false) to help me get started. I chose [this](https://startbootstrap.com/template/scrolling-nav) template because it was pretty simple and understandable. After I downloaded the template, I forgot what command I had to use to unzip the file so I can see the folders and files of code. I went back to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHmKH2vwVGM) video and then remembered that I need to move the zipped file into my repo first then use `unzip file-name`.

The first thing I did after unzipping the file was changing the *navbar* and the *header* of the website. For the *navbar*, I put the different sections of the website like *today* and *future*. I had a little trouble linking them to the sections because I forgot to put the `#` on `href` of the navbar or put the `#` on the `id` of the section which doesn't need the `#`. Sometimes I also misspelled the `id` so it didn't work.

This is what the website looks like after I made the changes and the navbar functions correctly.

To add my content into the website, I used `accordion`s from [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) and a couple of other bootstrap components. I didn't really have trouble getting them to work, but I did with their placement on the website. I looked at the [columns](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/columns/) section of the website and used the code.

This is how it looks when everything is collapsed and when you click on them they will open and show the content of the past and future.

The part about *A-Frame* includes my *learning-log* which I used to record what I learned about *A-Frame*.

I had trouble getting this *MVP* done in time because I didn't manage my time correctly. My website still needs some big changes but I think I have a decent product. 

### Engineering Design Process
In the EDP, I have brainstormed the possible solutions for the problems in accounting. Now I am planning the most promising solution and starting to create a prototype for the potential future.

### Skills
A skill I have improved on is **Growth Mindset**. I was starting to feel overwhelmed by all the work from school and uncapable of completing it. I tried my best to have patience and persevere as much as possible. Now, I am starting to feel more like I can continue trying challenging things and overcoming difficult tasks.

Another skill is **Embracing Failure**. I haven't really been able to keep up with the assignments from school or do them in the best manner. This has helped me learn more about what I need to improve on and think about changes I need to make to not commit the same mistakes again.
