# Entry 6: Building a MVP
##### 5/1/24

### MVP
To make a *Minimum Viable Product* website for **Accounting**, I had to choose a [bootstrap template](https://startbootstrap.com/?showAngular=false&showVue=false&showPro=false) to help me get started. I chose [this](https://startbootstrap.com/template/scrolling-nav) template because it was pretty simple and understandable. After I downloaded the template, I forgot what command I had to use to unzip the file so I can see the folders and files of code. I went back to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHmKH2vwVGM) video and then remembered that I need to move the zipped file into my repo first then use `unzip file-name`.

The first thing I did after unzipping the file was changing the *navbar* and the *header* of the website. For the *navbar*, I put the different sections of the website like *today* and *future*. I had a little trouble linking them to the sections because I forgot to put the `#` on `href` of the navbar or put the `#` on the `id` of the section which doesn't need the `#`. Sometimes I also misspelled the `id` so it didn't work.

### Engineering Design Process
In the EDP, I have brainstormed the possible solutions for the problems in accounting. Now I am planning the most promising solution and starting to create a prototype for the potential future.

### Skills
A skill I have improved on is **Growth Mindset**. I was starting to feel overwhelmed by all the work from school and uncapable of completing it. I tried my best to have patience and persevere as much as possible. Now, I am starting to feel more like I can continue trying challenging things and overcoming difficult tasks.

Another skill is **Embracing Failure**. I haven't really been able to keep up with the assignments from school or do them in the best manner. This has helped me learn more about what I need to improve on and think about changes I need to make to not commit the same mistakes again.
