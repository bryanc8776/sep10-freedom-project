# Entry 6: Building a MVP
##### 5/1/24

### MVP
To make a *Minimum Viable Product* for **Accounting**, we had to make a website. 

### Engineering Design Process
In the EDP, I have brainstormed the possible solutions for the problems in accounting. Now I am planning the most promising solution and starting to create a prototype for the potential future.

### Skills
A skill I have improved on is **Growth Mindset**. I was starting to feel overwhelmed by all the work from school and uncapable of completing it. I tried my best to have patience and persevere as much as possible. Now, I am starting to feel more like I can continue trying challenging things and overcoming difficult tasks.

Another skill is **Embracing Failure**. I haven't really been able to keep up with the assignments from school or do them in the best manner. This has helped me learn more about what I need to improve on and think about changes I need to make to not commit the same mistakes again.
