# Entry 5: Learning A-Frame
##### 4/8/24

### A-Frame
Throughout the *LOYO* (Learn On Your Own) process, I have learned a lot more about my tool, **A-Frame**, and the way it works. I mainly used the [**A-Frame**](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) documents and watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP3KjR1TMw7ekqC4o5gy0rR4odw7Jga84) tutorial series to figure out how **A-Frame** works. The main documents I used were "[Building a Basic Scene](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/guides/building-a-basic-scene.html)", "[HTML & Primitives](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/html-and-primitives.html)", "[Entity-Component-System](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/entity-component-system.html)", and "[Mixins](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/core/mixins.html)". The main videos that helped me from the tutorial series were "[Transformations, Primitives & Textures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mETucqeOmXA&list=PLP3KjR1TMw7ekqC4o5gy0rR4odw7Jga84&index=2)", "[ECS Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qB8Ejh_QdpE)", "[Cursor and Gaze Controls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_pq9EuE-o0&list=PLP3KjR1TMw7ekqC4o5gy0rR4odw7Jga84&index=11)", and "[Mixins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjvvtIQwaqo&list=PLP3KjR1TMw7ekqC4o5gy0rR4odw7Jga84&index=11)". The documents helped me understand how to incorporate different things and make them function and the videos showed me how to write the code and understand more. I learned many things about **A-Frame** such as how to incorporate `assets`(textures/images for the background or scene), add `text` to the scene, and use `entities`, `primitives`, and `components`. 

### Skills
A skill I have improved on while learning **A-Frame** is **Attention to detail**. When coding, it was very important to spell everything correct or else it won't work or appear in the preview. I misspelled some words which made me think that I used the wrong code. After looking back at the videos and examples, I realized that I didn't spell things like `property` correctly or I was missing a `;` so I fixed it and made sure everything was good.

Another skill I have developed more is **Organization**. While learning **A-Frame**, we had to keep track of the resources we used and what we changed/tinkered with. We did this in a file (*learning-log.md*) and I used bullet points and indented the information that was part of the bullet point. I also labeled the day I tinkered and kept *code snippets* of what I made in each day.
