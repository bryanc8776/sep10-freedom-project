### A-Frame
Throughout the *LOYO* (Learn On Your Own) process, I have learned a lot more about my tool, **A-Frame**, and the way it works. I mainly used the [**A-Frame**](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) documents and watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP3KjR1TMw7ekqC4o5gy0rR4odw7Jga84) tutorial series.
