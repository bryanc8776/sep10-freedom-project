# Entry 5: Learning A-Frame
##### 4/8/24

### A-Frame
Throughout the *LOYO* (Learn On Your Own) process, I have learned a lot more about my tool, **A-Frame**, and the way it works. I mainly used the [**A-Frame**](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) documents and watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP3KjR1TMw7ekqC4o5gy0rR4odw7Jga84) tutorial series.

### Skills
A skill I have improved on while learning **A-Frame** is **Attention to detail**. When coding, it was very important to spell everything correct or else it won't work or appear in the preview. I misspelled some words which made me think that I used the wrong code. After looking back at the videos and examples, I realized that I didn't spell things like `property` correctly or I was missing a `;` so I fixed it and made sure everything was good.
