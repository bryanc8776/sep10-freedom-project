# Entry 1: Deciding on My Topic (Accounting)
##### 10/24/23


### Choosing a topic
The topic I chose to research for this project is accounting. I thought about making my project about sports or restaurants, but I felt like accounting is a more challenging topic and needs more improvements. Despite not choosing the other topics, I still did some research on them. Some articles I found interesting and really informative are ["The Most Important Types of Restaurant Technology and Hardware"](https://pos.toasttab.com/blog/types-of-restaurant-technology) by Toast, ["Restaurant technology trends to watch in 2024"](https://hospitalityinsights.ehl.edu/restaurant-technology-trends) by EHL Insights, and ["The Evolution of Technology in Sport"](https://www.hire-intelligence.co.uk/evolution-of-technology-in-sport/#:~:text=Tracking%20Race%20Times,record%20times%20at%20antenna%20points) by Hire Intelligence. Some of the articles that made me choose accounting are ["The Future of Technology in Accounting"](https://accounting.uworld.com/blog/cpa-review/the-future-of-technology-in-accounting/#:~:text=The%20future%20of%20accounting%20will,to%20improve%20their%20soft%20skills.) by UWorld Accounting, ["Accounting Explained With Brief History and Modern Job Requirements"](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting.asp#:~:text=Accounting%20is%20the%20process%20of,regulators%2C%20and%20tax%20collection%20entities) by Investopedia, ["The Role of Technology In Modern Accounting"](https://online.mason.wm.edu/blog/the-role-of-technology-in-modern-accounting) by Raymond A. Mason School of Business, and ["Technology Limitations in Accounting"](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/technology-limitations-accounting-34162.html) by Shelley Frost. They provided a lot of information about accounting and how technology has been used in it.


### Engineering Design Process

Right now, I am in the first stage of the engineering design process, where we mainly have to define the problem. Some aspects of the problem I hope to solve are improving technology in accounting and helping it be more efficient and quicker. I am also trying to move on to the next stage in which we need to research the problem and try to come up with possible solutions. 


### Skills

One skill I developed during this portion of the project is **Problem Decomposition**. In this part of the project, I felt like it was a lot of work. After some struggle, I decided to first focus on researching how technology impacts my top 3 topics. I then chose a topic which is accounting.

Another skill I developed was **Growth Mindset**. I didn't really know what topics I wanted to do for this project, so I asked my sister for some advice. Patience was also necessary for me to complete my research and try to find some articles that would really help me by providing more information.
