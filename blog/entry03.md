# Entry 3: Finalizing Content
##### 12/18/23

### Ideas
After finishing up the research on technology in accounting, I came up with some possible inventions to improve accounting.
* App: I tried to use the things existing apps didn't have to come up with a possible app that will include the missing parts and some features that are already in them.
* Machine: Similar to the app, I tried to include some of the features that other gadgets and hardware missed while also utilizing some that seem important.
* My classmates' feedback on ***[Slack](https://slack.com)*** also helped me improve my ideas and figure out ways to make an efficient creation.

### Content
After forming ideas that seem pretty decent and will change accounting for the better, I finalized my content that will go on my website. 
1. I first focused on making a good introduction to the website that covers what accounting is and how technology has affected it.
2. Then I went on to put the past/present of accounting which includes the [**software**](https://www.business.org/finance/accounting/best-accounting-apps/) apps and [**hardware**](https://www.abrigo.com/blog/tech-hardware-for-accountants-advisors-a-primer/) [**equipment**](https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/news/innovation/2019-02-15-ces-accountant-gadgets#:~:text=1.,cloud%2Dbased%20accountant's%20tool%20box) I found on the articles with some important details about them.
3. After that I solidified my inventions that could be the potential future of accounting and added details that describe their function.

### Engineering Design Process
In the EDP, I have defined the problem, done research, and now formed possible solutions that will help change accounting and improve the way technology is used. I feel like I have brainstormed good ideas and can move onto step 4, in which we have to plan the most promising solution.
