### Ideas
After finishing up the research on technology in accounting, I came up with some possible inventions to improve accounting. 
* App: I tried to use the things existing apps didn't have to come up with a possible app that will include the missing parts and some features that are already in them.
* Machine: Similar to the app, I tried to include some of the features that other gadgets and hardware missed while also utilizing some that seem important.
