# Entry 7: Final Product and Presentations
##### 5/31/24

### Final Product
After a long year of SEP, I was able to make a functional [website](https://bryanc8776.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) about the technology in accounting using everything I learned about HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and my LOYO tool, A-Frame. To show my creation, I had to present my process and what I made to my class and the judges. 

#### In-class Presentation 
To present what I made to my classmates and Mr. Mueller, I had to make a [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zWHfVszzge9CPCDHXpNCjdrtVOkf526HdngcFw6hTd0/edit#slide=id.p). Before making it, I had to plan what I wanted to say and show them about accounting and my process in my [SEP notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d4Iqk_jFlNMwwHxfGTrjYoIKm6YPVg-3qGr8oqAbF5s/edit#heading=h.6o1f62qg6jz9). I planned on telling them a fact about how technology can transform accounting, things I searched for to complete part A (the past/present of accounting), what my ideas are for part B (the future) and how I used A-Frame to build a prototype, and how I used bootstrap to make my website.

##### Takeaways
Some takeaways from giving my in-class presentation are:
* a hook is very important to engage the audience
* having less words and more visuals makes the presentation more captivating
* speaking loud and confidently is important to also maintain your audience engaged
* keeping eye contact and using body language helps convey meaning to what is being said and show confidence
* it is important to make it clear when you finished presenting like saying "thank you" or asking a closing question
