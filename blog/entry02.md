# Entry 2: Research 
##### 11/27/23

### Findings
After choosing accounting as my topic and writing blog 1, I have done more research on the types of software and hardware found in accounting. By searching on google, I was able to find some interesting articles to help me gather more information and ideas.

#### Software
For software, I searched "Accounting apps this year" and found this [article](https://www.business.org/finance/accounting/best-accounting-apps/). Some of the software apps and their attributes found in the article include:
* Zoho Books: Builds automated workflows
* Xero: Accounting easy and affordable
* QuickBooks Online: Mobile app, Send invoices with attached receipts via text, email, or messaging appâ€”with the additional security of an encrypted link.
* FreshBooks: Customizable recurring invoices that easily sync with the time tracking features
* Sage Business Cloud Accounting: user friendly with colorful, easy-to-read dashboard reports and online trainings that help first-time business owners start establishing their companies.

Another search I did was "Top 10 accounting software" and found another [article](https://www.softwareworld.co/best-accounting-software/). I haven't done much reading on it, but it includes many of the apps I saw in the first article.

#### Hardware
For hardware, one google search I made was "Accounting Hardware" and chose this [article](https://www.abrigo.com/blog/tech-hardware-for-accountants-advisors-a-primer/). It gave a lot of examples of tech that is highly recommended for accounting and that would help the accountant. There were business-grade and home-grade laptops/desktops such as:

* HP desktops: EliteDesk, ProDesk, EliteOne, ProOne, Z-series
* Dell laptops: Latitude, some Vostro, Precision Mobile Workstation devices
* Lenovo desktops: M-series, P-series, Thinkcentre, Thinkstation
* Microsoft Surface Pro, Surface Book
* HP laptops: Stream, Streambook, Pavilion, Phoenix, Envy, Omen, Spectre
* Lenovo laptops: Ideapad, Flex, E, N, Y, G, L, S, U, and Z-series, Yoga devices other than Thinkpad models
* Dell desktops: Inspiron, XPS, Alienware, 3000, 5000, and 7000 series
* All Chromebooks, Chromeboxes

After thinking many people might know about most of these hardware, I did another google search on "Accounting Technological gadgets". The [article](https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/news/innovation/2019-02-15-ces-accountant-gadgets#:~:text=1.,cloud%2Dbased%20accountant%27s%20tool%20box) included 4 gadgets; the Fujitsu Scansnap IX1500, Cemtrex Smartdesk, Vuzix Blade Glasses, and Lenovo Thinkvision P44W. These gadgets will provide an increased efficiency as well as make accounting smoother.


### Engineering Design Process
In the Engineering Design Process, I have mostly defined the problem which is to improve the efficiency of technology in accounting and make it more known. Now, in step two, I have done most of my research that I will need to help me move onto the next step which is brainstorming possible solutions.


### Skills
A skill I have grown in is **Organization**. In order to comprhend the information from the articles better, I had to take notes. For my notes, I used bullet points for the software apps and hardware gadgets and then indented every important detail that was part of the specific app/gadget.

Another skill is **How to Google**. At first, my search for hardware was *Accounting Hardware*, but I didn't really see many specific tools or equipment. I then changed my search to *Accounting Technological gadgets* which helped me find a better source with more information on specific gadgets.
