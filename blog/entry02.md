### Findings
After choosing accounting as my topic and writing blog 1, I have done more research on the types of software and hardware found in accounting. By searching on google, I was able to find some interesting articles to help me gather more information and ideas.

#### Software
For software, I searched "Accounting apps this year" and found [this article](https://www.business.org/finance/accounting/best-accounting-apps/). Some of the software apps found in the article include
* Zoho Books
* Xero
* QuickBooks Online
* FreshBooks
* Sage Business Cloud Accounting

Another search I did was "Top 10 accounting software" and found [another article](https://www.softwareworld.co/best-accounting-software/). I haven't done much reading on it, but it includes many of the apps I saw in the first article.

#### Hardware
